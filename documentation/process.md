# Jan 22nd - Sonder
This is a narrative game centering the experience of sonder, a realization that every person on the planet is
an individual with an existence as rich and complex as oneself.

## The concept

For this seemingly limitless project, I began by constricting myself by the software I'd be using. 
I picked Bitsy for the easy pixel art possibilities and narration game style. 
I wanted to try something new, and I randomly thought about the concept of sonder, so I decided to base my game on that. 

## The process

This was my first time using the software, and after watching a few tutorials [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJtuDQuZvQY) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8lsVZ6QcA), I was
good to go. I started by imagining the scene and sketching a bit, and then I created it on Bitsy. 

## Future considerations

I don't feel like I gave this project the love I should, so I'd love to repurpose the idea for another project because the subject intrigues me. 
The experience of sonder is an important piece of the process of developing a nuanced, empathetic view of the humans around us, and I would love
to see how a game can enhance and complicate it.

# Jan 29th
This is the week I was supposed to play around in Unity to get a feel for it. I’m having issues with storage, so Unity isn’t on my machine yet, but I’ll update this in a few days once I get that resolved.

So far, I’ve gotten to explore Unity on the school computer and through tutorials. I’m impressed by the number of possibilities that the engine offers and am eager to learn more.

# Feb 5th
For this week, I prototyped a segment of a game idea I've been holding onto.
