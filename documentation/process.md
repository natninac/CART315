# The concept

For this seemingly limitless project, I began by constricting myself by the software I'd be using. 
I picked Bitsy for the easy pixel art possibilities and narration game style. 
I wanted to try something new, and I randomly thought about the concept of sonder, so I decided to base my game on that.
