# Sonder
This is a narrative game centering the experience of sonder, a realization that every person on the planet is
an individual with an existence as rich and complex as oneself.

## The concept

For this seemingly limitless project, I began by constricting myself by the software I'd be using. 
I picked Bitsy for the easy pixel art possibilities and narration game style. 
I wanted to try something new, and I randomly thought about the concept of sonder, so I decided to base my game on that. 

## The process

This was my first time using the software, and after watching a few tutorials [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJtuDQuZvQY) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8lsVZ6QcA), I was
good to go. I started by imagining the scene and sketching a bit, and then I created it on Bitsy. 

## Future considerations

I don't feel like I gave this project the love I should, so I'd love to repurpose the idea for another project because the subject intrigues me. 
The experience of sonder is an important piece of the process of developing a nuanced, empathetic view of the humans around us, and I would love
to see how a game can enhance and complicate it.
