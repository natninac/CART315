# Jan 22nd - Sonder
This is a narrative game centering the experience of sonder, a realization that every person on the planet is
an individual with an existence as rich and complex as oneself.

## The concept

For this seemingly limitless project, I began by constricting myself by the software I'd be using. 
I picked Bitsy for the easy pixel art possibilities and narration game style. 
I wanted to try something new, and I randomly thought about the concept of sonder, so I decided to base my game on that. 

## The process

This was my first time using the software, and after watching a few tutorials [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJtuDQuZvQY) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8lsVZ6QcA), I was
good to go. I started by imagining the scene and sketching a bit, and then I created it on Bitsy. 

## Future considerations

I don't feel like I gave this project the love I should, so I'd love to repurpose the idea for another project because the subject intrigues me. 
The experience of sonder is an important piece of the process of developing a nuanced, empathetic view of the humans around us, and I would love
to see how a game can enhance and complicate it.

This is the week I was supposed to play around in Unity to get a feel for it. I’m having issues with storage, so Unity isn’t on my machine yet, but I’ll update this in a few days once I get that resolved.

So far, I’ve gotten to explore Unity on the school computer and through tutorials. I’m impressed by the number of possibilities that the engine offers and am eager to learn more.

# Feb 5th
For this week, I prototyped a segment of a game idea I've been holding onto. 

## A bit about the game

  It's a game concept I started exploring before starting my degree. The idea and the world I created feel very atmospheric and cool, but I always wondered if the game would really be engaging to players.
The gameplay is essentially a puzzle/survival hybrid. After years of a relentless winter that refuses to go away, the main character's community have all left for a warmer climate.
The protagonist is indigenous to this land, and resists departing, no matter how harsh and eternal the winter seems to be. He is then left all alone to fend for himself, and his only
communication method with his family is through AM radio signals. This means that he must do all maintenance and repairs on the radio towers.


## The gameplay
The gameplay consists of various survival tasks: eating, drinking and staying warm. There are hundreds of games with survival mechanics so I know they are engaging (or have the potential
to be). The other side of this is the puzzle gameplay. I want the maintenance and repairs of the radio towers to act as puzzles, but I don't know how to make that fun, engaging, difficult. To start 
prototyping, I had to research the radio towers and understand how they work.

I also sketched out some maps to see what kind of information should be shown on them, and how it should be shown.

At last, I drafted the first mission (the onboarding) of the game using Twine. This helped me figure out different pathways (winning, losing, decisions), which are the start of figuring out how to make
this idea more fun.

# Feb 12th
For this week, I attempted to get started with some Unity mechanics. The prototyping goal was to start fleshing out what my game idea would play like and if it could be interesting/playable.
I decided to work on a navigation feature. In the game, the main character only has two wayfinding methods: paper maps and radio direction finding. RDF is only used nowadays by hobbyists or 
for more hardcore tasks like military intelligence and search & rescue. My character, however, lives in a post-apocalyptic world in which radio signals are his only option.

## How this looks in the game
RDF opens up interesting gameplay options, by complexifying communication and navigation if the equipment is faulty. For example, if a tower is down, the player won't be able to find it on their digital map, because it might not be 
sending any signals.

I wanted to start the exploration by prototyping what happens when the player moves too far from a tower. It seems quite simple but I am quite rusty from coding, so this took a while:

Player is the square, tower is the circle.

As the player moves further away, the tower loses opacity.

Until it completely disappears

## Future use
I plan on continuing to use this project and build on top of it, or simply reuse the mechanics. I'll be adding more towers and different effects, because I am realizing that loss of opacity
isn't a very realistic phenomenon. In the real world, the location might become visibly unstable or flickery.
